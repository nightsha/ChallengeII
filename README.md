##Junior Web Developer

As a junior web developer I want a portfolio that will
showcase my front-end/back-end skills.As a devoloper I want to insure 
my contact information is up to date and accessible to any 
potential employer! It is done when my phone number and e-
mail are available. It is done when a link is made available
to prospective employers to view my portfolio at https://github.com/nightsha/ChallengeII
I had assitance with this project from T/A Kevin Long and in the early stages tutor Trinh
Nguyen provided a good starting point. The mistakes and foibles are mine alone.
