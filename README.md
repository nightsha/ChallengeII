# ChallengeII

As a junior web developer I want a portfolio that will
showcase my front-end/back-end skills.As a devoloper I want to insure 
my contact information is up to date and accessible to any 
potential employer! It is done when my phone number and e-
mail are available. It is done when a link is made available
to prospective emplpoyers to view my portfolio at https://github.com/nightsha/Challenge-I
